### What am I
---
Video-Sync, until I can come up with a swankier name, is an application for hosting/watching media content online with your friends, family, strangers, or by yourself pretending you have friends. While many platforms exist already to host or watch media online very few exist that keep all players synchronized so they are watching/listening to the same part of the media. The idea behind this is an application with minimal setup for the administrator and zero setup for any other party so that anyone can enjoy their favorite media with the people they want to share it with online but with the same epxerience as you are all watching tv together.

### Setup

1. Node version >= 8.4.0
