<h3 id="what-am-i">What am I</h3>
<hr>
<p>Video-Sync, until I can come up with a swankier name, is an application for hosting/watching media content online with your friends, family, strangers, or by yourself pretending you have friends. While many platforms exist already to host or watch media online very few exist that keep all players synchronized so they are watching/listening to the same part of the media at the same time. The idea behind this is an application with minimal setup for the administrator and zero setup for any other party so that anyone can enjoy their favorite media with the people they want to share it with online but with the same experience as you are all watching tv together.</p>
<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<hr>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Node version &gt;= 8.4.0</li>
<li>Ffmpeg version &gt;= 2.7.6</li>
<li>Redis version &gt;= 3.0.3</li>
<li>Git</li>
<li>Chrome</li>
</ol>
<p>Download and install git if you do not already have it. Then clone this repository. If you are on Windows on a version less than 10 I would recommend getting Git Bash as it will use the same commands that linux does for installing the application environment.</p>
<p>Install nodejs and run the following commands from within the directory where you downloaded the code repository.</p>
<p><code>npm install npm@latest -g</code> <em>Updates npm: may require elevated access to run</em></p>
<p><code>npm install</code> <em>Installs the necessary dependencies</em></p>
<p>Install FFmpeg and add it to your path.</p>
<p>Install Redis and add it to your path. Odds are Redis will be installed as a startup service so it will prevent you from starting the application as it will bind to 6379 not allowing the application to. Either you can stop this default behavior, it is a documented feature, or use terminal commands to terminate the process running on 6379.</p>
<p>Setup your <a href="#configs">Configs</a>.</p>
<p>Finally you will need to forward the port that you configured in the configs on your local router to resolve to your machine in the network subnet.</p>
<p>Start:
<code>npm run-script start</code>
Stop:
<code>Ctl-X in the same terminal</code></p>
<p>To connect to the client as an admin open chrome and go to <a href="https://127.0.0.1:8080/html/client.html">https://127.0.0.1:8080/html/client.html</a></p>
<ul>
<li>8080 - (port specified in the <a href="#configs">Config</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using the default self signed certificate when you will need to click past the browsers security warning to proceed.</p>
<h3 id="watch-a-video">Watch a Video</h3>

<h3 id="synchronization-techniques">Synchronization Techniques</h3>
<hr>
<p>Currently the synchronization events happen when a pause or seek video event is triggered. All users are set to the furthest behind persons time stamp. If a user joins or triggers a resync when they are desynced the server will set their video to the furthest ahead persons time.</p>
<p>The system will not currently stop players if they fall out of sync but if a sync issue is noticed a pause will synchronize everyone.</p>
<p>On the control bar under the gear icon there is a checkbox called &quot;Synchronize&quot;. If that box is checked the player will receive sync events and act on them. If that box is unchecked then the individual player can issue any video command without causing those events to be sent out to any other player. The video player will also no longer respond to the server sync events.</p>
<p>On a play or seek event the server will not issue a resume command until it has received that each client is in a state where it has enough video/audio data to start playing.</p>
<h3 id="video-controls">Video Controls</h3>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Play/Pause: Issues play or pause to the player</li>
<li>Progress bar: Shows the current progress of the video as well as allows the seek action</li>
<li>Audio: Mute or Unmute audio</li>
<li>Volume: Adjust the volume of the player</li>
<li>Options:<ul>
<li>Type: Select the type of video codec(currently only webm is supported)</li>
<li>Video: Select the Video quality to watch</li>
<li>Audio: Select the Audio quality to watch</li>
<li>Subtitles: Select the Subtitles to display is available</li>
<li>Buffer: How far ahead to buffer the file</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Fullscreen: Make the player fullscreen</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="log-in">Log in</h3>
<hr>
<p>The Log in prompt has three fields</p>
<ul>
<li>Handle: The users desired moniker</li>
<li>Email: The email address the user received the invitation with</li>
<li>Token: A system generated token emailed to the users</li>
</ul>
<p>To get a token just submit your email and handle in the prompt. If you are a valid user then the system will generate a random password and email it to the email you entered. If you accidentally closed the prompt click the button of a person on the left side bar. Only one user can be logged in per email address at a time one.</p>
<p>As a client logging in you might see a warning screen saying the site is not secured. This is due to the fact that the application uses a self signed certificate. To get to the site click through the warnings and allow the page to resolve.</p>
<p>Allowed Characters per Field</p>
<ul>
<li>Handle: <a href="#misc">String</a></li>
<li>Email: <a href="#misc">Email</a></li>
<li>Token: <a href="#misc">String</a></li>

<h3 id="session">Session</h3>
<hr>
<p>The session form can be reached by the admin only using the side bar on the left hand side of the screen and selecting the plus sign at the top of the list.</p>
<p>The session form is for setting up a list of valid users and a valid email. The specified list of users will be entered into the system to be able to generate tokens and log in to the session. The email will be used to send invitations to the users in question as well as send them the system generated token to log in.</p>
<p>Form:</p>
<ul>
<li>Title: Name of the session<ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="email">Email</h3>
<hr>
<p>The email form can be accessed by selecting the envelope icon on the left hand side bar. The email form is for registering an email account to the application. This email will be used to send invitations and tokens to the users specified in the active <a href="#Session">Session</a>.</p>
<p>This feature has only been tested with gmail as of right now. To work with gmail the account in question will need to have 2 factor authentication setup. Once that is done you can now generate token passwords through your gmail account to use your email account which is what you will need to do in order to integrate the application with gmail.</p>
<p>Form:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type: Ignore</li>
<li>Host: The provider of your email<ul>
<li>ex: gmail <a href="#misc">String</a></li>

<h3 id="encoding">Encoding</h3>
<hr>
<p>This is the front end interface with the Ffmpeg encoding solution. Currently it only supports webm encoding at the moment.</p>
<p>Form:</p>
<ul>
<li>File to Encode: The path to the file to be encoded</li>
<li>Metadata: When the File has been specified then the metadata field will populate with the files meta info. Each tab represents a stream in the codec.</li>
<li>Output Directory: The directory to save all the encoded files to.</li>
<li>Encoding Options: These options will encode the specified file into a web compliant set of media file(s)<ul>
<li>Video: The desired video quality</li>
<li>Audio: The desired Audio quality</li>
<li>Subtitle: The desired Subtitle stream track, if left blank will just grab the first one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Encoding Commands: A list of what the back end commands will look like.</li>
</ul>
<p>Buttons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Video/Audio: takes the specified quality and creates a well formatted command Video/Audio encoding command</li>
<li>Subtitle: will pull out a specific subtitle track</li>
<li>Encode: Will submit the commands to the back end to encode</li>
</ul>
<p>Encoding commands Explained:
The list of commands under encoding commands are a list of valid Ffmpeg commands that are just missing the Ffmpeg keyword infront of them. This being the case if
ou need to you can type in those fields and tweak the fields to have the desired changes and then submit them. If you are interested in this option I would recommend reading the Ffmpeg docs as well as reading up on DASH encodings.</p>
<p>The entries under this list will not update their values if they were changed above. Instead you will need to select the &#39;x&#39; in the far right column to remove that entry and recreate it.</p>
<p>You might also notice there is an entry that populates on its own called the &#39;MANIIFEST&#39;. This is a metadata file that parses all encoded files to get their metadata. This is a required file for playing html5 compliant web videos. This field will auto update as new entries are added or removed. Though if you did encode media files outside the application then you can actually force the application to only generate the manifest. This is necessary as their is custom information that it will populate in the manifest file through outside processes.</p>
<p>To force the application to only generate the metadata construct all the commands as you normally would. then instead of submitting them select the checkbox on the manifest entry. This action will lock the manifest and preventing it from updating. Delete all the entries by selecting the &#39;x&#39; button on the right of each entry. he manifest will be left untouched. Now click submit and it will only generate the manifest file.</p>
<p>You can watch the progress of an encoding by either pulling up the developer console or selecting the Log Tab next to the Chat Tab.</p>
<h3 id="path-bar">Path bar</h3>
<hr>
<p>On the Admins client the path bar will be on the top of the screen. The button on the left is the load video button and the bar to the right is the absolute path to the directory structure that has the media files in it located on your system.</p>
<p>If the video player gets in a non recoverable state selecting the load button will force a reload of the video for all connected clients. This should resolve any deadlocks allowing you to seek back to where you left off and continue.</p>
<h3 id="chat">Chat</h3>
<hr>
<p>A general communication center that will show user messages as well as user actions that interact with the video. By default the general allowed characters in chat are <a href="#misc">Special</a>. If the first character of the string is a &#39;/&#39; then it is recognized as a command.</p>
<p>Commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play: Resumes play on a video<ul>
<li>ex: /play</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pause: Pauses a video<ul>
<li>ex: /pause</li>

<h3 id="logs">Logs</h3>
<hr>
<p>Logs are split into three types. A masterProcess, serverProcess, and stateProcess. The masterProcess is responsible for spinning up the entire application. The serverProcess is responsible for most of the features of the application such as user login, requesting video data, and other non stateful calls. The stateProcess is used to keep the players synced and all other stateful operations in the application.</p>
<p>Each thread of the application creates its own log file with the PID used as the unique identifier.</p>
<p>Location:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows: %APPDATA%/video-sync/logs/</li>
<li>Linux: ~/.config/video-sync/logs/</li>
<li>Mac: ~/.config/video-sync/logs/</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="configs">Configs</h3>
<hr>
<p>When the application is started for the first time it will populate the associated dir with a default config template which you can then edit as necessary.</p>
<p>Location:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows: %APPDATA%/video-sync/</li>
<li>Linux: ~/.config/video-sync/</li>
<li>Mac: ~/.config/video-sync/</li>
</ul>
<p>Example Config</p>
<pre><code>{
  &quot;host&quot; : &quot;xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx&quot;,
  &quot;port&quot; : 8080,
  &quot;static&quot; : &quot;static&quot;,
  &quot;redis&quot; : {
    &quot;host&quot; : &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;,
    &quot;port&quot; : 6379,
    &quot;password&quot; : null
  },
  &quot;redisStartUp&quot; : {
    &quot;bin&quot; : &quot;/usr/bin/redis-server&quot;
  }
}
</code></pre><p>Config Definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>host: The external ip that given to you by your isp.</li>
<li>port: The port that your application will start up on.</li>
<li>static: The base static file directory of that application.</li>
<li>redis: The specs of the redis server.<ul>
<li>If you wish to change the info on redis you will need to also edit the redis.config</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>redisStartUp(optional): Pass in the dir to redis instead of using a class path.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the same directory as the configs is the certificate for the applications https encryption. It will be auto generated if there is not already one there.</p>
<h3 id="misc">Misc</h3>
<hr>
<p><strong>Input Type Definitions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>String: Alphanumeric, spaces, and underscores</li>
<li>Email: An email patterned string that allows alphanumerics and [._-]</li>
<li>Special: Alphanumeric, spaces, and [?!&amp;:;@.,/_-&#39;&quot;\]</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>
<hr>
<p>Is the user in question using chrome as the default browser? It is the only browser this application is compatible with as of now.</p>
<p>Are you getting a warning insecure site when loading the page? This is an error browsers throw if a site is using a self signed certificate for https. Bypass the exception and everything will work as intended.</p>
<p>Client side logs are in the developer console in the browser.
Server side <a href="#logs">Logs</a> are in the same dir structure as the configs.</p>
